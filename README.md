# Monte Carlo Simulation: Chegg Inc. Investment Scenarios

This project models the potential future outcomes of an investment in **Chegg Inc.** using a robust, scenario-based **Monte Carlo simulation**. It evaluates downside and upside probabilities such as bankruptcy, buyout, turnaround, and stagnation â€” generating thousands of simulations to quantify risk and return using real-world data like corporate bond yields and business segments. As someone who enjoys value investing and picking stocks, I came across Chegg as a potential investment. However, this business is in distress and is going through turbulence, which is a type of company I usually want to avoid. I wanted to use Monte Carlo to project what might happen to the company and as a result how much money there is to be made or lost. I made the project in a way so that you can clone it, change the constants in `config.py` and run this for any distressed business stock.

## Why This Project Matters

In a volatile investing environment, probabilistic thinking can offer superior insight to static valuation models. This simulation combines:

- **Market-driven financial signals** (bond yield spreads)
- **Scenario-weighted distributions** (triangular forecasting)
- **Investor-centered metrics** (ROI %, dollar gain, cumulative return)
- **High-quality visualizations** worthy of financial dashboards

The goal of this is to get the odds on your side, and use Math to see how likely you are to profit from investing in a distressed, riskier stock.
